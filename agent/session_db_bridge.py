"""Small sync bridge helpers for SessionDB calls.

Hermes can run with either the SQLite ``SessionDB`` (sync methods) or an
async-backed SessionDB implementation (for example Postgres).  Some agent
paths are intentionally synchronous: CLI/gateway initialization, the main
conversation loop, and background threads.  Calling an async SessionDB method
from those paths returns a coroutine object; if the caller neither awaits nor
bridges it, Python emits ``RuntimeWarning: coroutine ... was never awaited``
and the intended DB operation never happens.

    details used elsewhere in the project.
