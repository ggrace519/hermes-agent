"""L1 storage helpers — async PG read/write over the ``l1_*`` tables.

Module-level async functions (not a repo class) per the Phase D spec §2,
sharing the Hermes ``hermes_db`` pool. Every function accepts an optional
``conn=`` so a transactional caller (the Parser's consolidation handshake)
can run the whole write — entities, relationships, citations, and the
``substrate_slices`` flip — inside one transaction.

The write path (:func:`persist_extraction` + :func:`mark_slices_consolidated`)
is what makes the consolidation handshake of design §5.7 live; the read
helpers back the recall L1 header (Phase D3) and the inspect CLI.
