"""``SubAgent`` base class + intensity dial.

Every substrate sub-agent (Sentinel, Curator, Reflector, ...) subclasses
``SubAgent`` so the lifecycle and intensity-dial machinery are uniform.
Phase A ships stubs (Sentinel passes everything, Conductor holds state
with no policy) but the contract here is the **same** one Phase B+ real
sub-agents will honor.

Intensity is per-agent: each agent reads a :class:`Level` and sleeps
between ticks proportional to it (see ``_INTERVAL_BY_LEVEL`` below).
``OFF`` is a hard stop — ``tick()`` is never called. The mapping is
deliberately conservative; Phase B+ may add per-agent overrides via a
class attribute.

Sentinel agents (``is_sentinel = True``) have a floor of ``FULL`` —
``set_intensity()`` silently coerces below-FULL settings back to FULL.
This enforces "Sentinel is never throttled" as a design invariant.
