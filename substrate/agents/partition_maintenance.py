"""Partition-maintenance worker.

Keeps the rolling window of monthly partitions on ``substrate_slices``
ahead of ``now()`` so writes never land in the DEFAULT partition
during steady-state operation. Runs once at boot and then daily.

PG 17 propagates parent-table indexes to every present and future
partition — this worker only issues the ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
... PARTITION OF`` DDL, never re-creates indexes per partition.

This is the cheapest sub-agent in Phase A: a daily tick that issues
3 idempotent statements. The tick interval is fixed at 24h regardless
of the configured intensity level, because the underlying work is
calendar-bound rather than load-bound.
