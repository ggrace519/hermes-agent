"""Phase E1 Associator — weaves the L2 associative graph over L1 entities.

Each tick (intensity-dialled, LOW floor), the Associator looks at entities
touched since its last tick and strengthens two kinds of *discovered*
association (distinct from the explicit L1 relationships the Parser
extracts):

* ``co_occurrence`` — entities cited by the same L0 slice.
* ``shared_neighbor`` — entities that share a relationship partner.

Every weight change appends a ``substrate_association_edits`` row, so the
graph carries its own history (MVS §3.2) — the raw material the Critic
later audits against the salience landscape (MVS §3.7/§5.6, Phase F).

Gated by ``HERMES_SUBSTRATE_ASSOCIATOR`` (default ON; set to 0 to disable): registers +
heartbeats, but its tick is a no-op until an operator opts in — the same
staged-rollout pattern as the Parser. Per the Phase E1 spec §3.
