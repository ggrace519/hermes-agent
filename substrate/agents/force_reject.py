"""Pending-TTL force-reject worker.

Periodically removes slices that have been pending longer than their
stream's :attr:`DecayProfile.pending_ttl`. Independent of the Sentinel
decider — even if Sentinel hangs or falls behind, the pending queue
is bounded by the TTL. Hostile streams trying to inflate the queue are
defeated by the worker, not the Sentinel.

The TTL check is done **server-side** via native PG interval math
(``pending_committed_at + dp.pending_ttl < now()``) — no Python-side
date parsing, no string-encoded durations. The CTE-based DELETE keeps
the partition-key columns in both predicates so PG prunes to a single
partition per matched row.
