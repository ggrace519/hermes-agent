"""L0 public write API — :func:`commit_slice` (async) + sync facade.

This is the **only** public write surface in Phase A. Sentinel + the
force-reject worker read from ``SliceRepo`` directly because they're
internal substrate machinery; everything outside the substrate package
calls into ``commit_slice``.

Contract (from Phase A spec §4.2):

* Returns the slice's :class:`Address` once the PG INSERT is
  acknowledged. Does NOT block waiting for Sentinel.
* Validates stream lifecycle (must be ``ACTIVE``), modality vs payload
  shape, event-time skew (≤ now + 5 min), and TZ-awareness of
  ``event_time_world``.
* Reads ``payload_modality`` from the stream — the caller does not pass
  it (the stream owns its modality contract).
* If ``conn`` is passed, the INSERT runs on that connection so the
  caller can wrap it in a transaction shared with e.g.
  ``messages.append_message``. Otherwise the function acquires a
  connection from ``hermes_db.pool()`` for the duration of the call.
* Never uses ``::jsonb`` casts (the pool's JSONB codec handles
  encode/decode, per the Phase 0 ADR).
