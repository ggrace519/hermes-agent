"""StreamRepo — registration and lookup for ``substrate_streams``.

Streams are write-rare / read-hot: a single Hermes session emits
hundreds of slices per minute against a handful of streams, and each
:func:`commit_slice` call needs to know the stream's modality + lifecycle
state. So this repo caches every fetched stream in a bounded in-process
dict keyed by both ``stream_id`` and ``name``. ``invalidate()`` is
called explicitly when a lifecycle change happens (Phase B+ may flip
streams to ``paused`` or ``retired``).

The cache is intentionally small (256 entries) — Phase A has 15
auto-registered streams and a handful of dynamically-registered ones;
the bound is more about catching runaway-stream bugs than memory.

#
# The substrate also records its own *operational* decisions — Conductor
# dials, Sentinel batch summaries, Curator releases/alarms, and the L1–L4
# cognitive agents' activity. Those are telemetry, not perception. They are
# namespaced ``substrate.*`` (today only ``substrate.self_state``) and now
# live in ``substrate_telemetry`` (see :mod:`substrate.telemetry`).
#
# Treating operational telemetry as perception closed a self-sustaining
# feedback loop (2026-05-26→27 prod incident, 414k ghost slices): each
# emission counted as consolidation backlog, the Conductor pinned the
# Parser HIGH and emitted another event, and the events could never drain.
# This predicate is the schema-level guard so a *future* component writing
# to any ``substrate.*`` stream can't re-open the loop.
