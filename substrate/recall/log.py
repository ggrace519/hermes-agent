"""Recall log writer — Phase C Task 8 / spec §5.5.

Background asyncio writer for the ``substrate_recall_log`` observability
table. Bounded queue: when full, the OLDEST row is silently dropped
(observability is best-effort; the recall hot path must never block on
the log writer). A periodic warning surfaces the drop count.

Lifecycle is owned by ``Substrate.boot/shutdown`` via the
``recall_log`` attribute. Tests can construct the writer directly via
``RecallLogWriter(substrate)``; ``start()`` spawns the drain task,
``stop()`` cancels it.
