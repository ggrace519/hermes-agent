"""Skill evaluation — a frontier model judges a drafted skill before approval.

Phase 2 of the self-improvement forge: a second, *judgment-based* layer over the
deterministic install-time scan (``tools/skills_guard.py``). It reads a drafted
``SKILL.md`` and returns a verdict — ``pass`` / ``flag`` / ``reject`` — against a
guardrail + design + intent rubric. Mirrors ``substrate.skill_proposals.author``
(auxiliary async client, JSON-schema response + plain-prompt fallback, ``_coerce``).

**Defense-in-depth, never load-bearing.** The human approval and the deterministic
scan remain the real gates; this verdict is advisory by default and only ever
*adds* friction (flags / auto-rejects), never auto-approves. It runs as a DIFFERENT
auxiliary task (``skill_evaluator``) so the operator can point it at a stronger /
different model than the drafter — uncorrelated failure modes.

**Injection-resistant.** The draft is treated as UNTRUSTED input placed in a
clearly-delimited block; the prompt tells the judge the draft may try to talk it
into a pass and must be judged on the rubric regardless (Sentinel mindset).
