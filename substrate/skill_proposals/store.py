"""Skill-proposal storage — async PG helpers over ``substrate_skill_proposals``.

Mirrors the L3/L4 store conventions (``substrate.l3.store``): an ``_acquire``
context manager so callers may pass their own connection or get a fresh one,
and row→dataclass mappers. Backs the SkillScout (writes pending proposals) and
the ``skill_proposal`` tool (lists / shows / approves / rejects).
