"""align l3/l4 embedding dim to substrate_slices

Migration 0020 created ``l3_patterns``/``l4_observations``.embedding at
``vector(HERMES_EMBEDDING_DIM)`` (default 1536), mirroring how 0009 created
``substrate_slices.embedding``. But if ``HERMES_EMBEDDING_DIM`` isn't set in
the env at apply time while the install actually embeds at a different dim
(e.g. nomic-embed's 768, which ``substrate_slices`` uses), the new columns
mismatch the embedding model. The Curator's L3/L4 embed-backfill then fails
the pgvector dimension check on every row — silently, since the curation pass
degrades on error — so semantic merge never runs and the upper layers stop
shrinking. (Observed in prod 2026-05-28: l3/l4 at vector(1536), slices at
vector(768), 0/9173 L3 embedded.)

This removes the footgun: it aligns the l3/l4 embedding dimension to
``substrate_slices.embedding`` — the source of truth, since the Curator embeds
every layer with the same model — instead of relying on the env being set.
Idempotent: a no-op when already aligned. Empty/mismatched embeddings are
cleared (incompatible across dims anyway) and the Curator re-backfills.
