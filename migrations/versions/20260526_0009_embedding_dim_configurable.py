"""substrate slices embedding column — configurable dimension

Phase C migration 0006 pinned ``substrate_slices.embedding`` to
``vector(1536)`` to match OpenAI's ``text-embedding-3-small``. That
hard-codes operators into the OpenAI ecosystem (and OpenAI-compatible
proxies that happen to expose the same model). For local-only or
non-OpenAI providers — Ollama's ``nomic-embed-text`` (768-d),
``mxbai-embed-large`` (1024-d), Voyage ``voyage-3`` (1024-d), Google
Gemini ``gemini-embedding-001`` (768/1536/3072), etc. — that pin
prevents using the substrate at all.

This migration reads ``HERMES_EMBEDDING_DIM`` from the environment
(default 1536 — back-compat with every existing install) and reshapes
the column + ivfflat index to that dimension when they don't match.

Existing embeddings at the OLD dim are NOT convertible to the new dim
— different model spaces, different magnitudes. The migration sets the
column to NULL across the table when a dim change is needed; the
Curator's embedding-backfill loop (Phase C §5.7) picks up NULL-embedding
slices on its next tick and re-embeds at the new dim.

Operators changing dim AFTER first install need to:

  1. Stop hermes (so the Curator isn't mid-write):
        hermes gateway stop  # or just exit the CLI
  2. Set the new env var:
        export HERMES_EMBEDDING_DIM=768
  3. Re-run migrations (alembic detects this rev applied but
     ``upgrade_in_place`` reads the env each call, so a no-op upgrade
     followed by a manual re-apply via ``alembic stamp`` + repeat is
     needed — OR run the ALTER block below by hand against PG.
     A ``hermes substrate reembed-dim N`` CLI command is the proper
     long-term answer; not in this PR's scope).
  4. Restart hermes; Curator backfills new embeddings on the next tick
     (~30s of activity).

Cost note: clearing embeddings forces re-embed of every slice. With a
local model that's free. With a cloud model it's the per-token cost of
re-running embed() over every slice's payload text.

Revises: 20260526_0008  (Phase D parser audit — landed earlier today,
                         see PR llm-cognitive-thought#3 for the spec; the
                         hermes-agent side of Phase D will land separately)
Create Date: 2026-05-26

NOTE on down_revision: if Phase D's 0008 hasn't merged when this
migration ships, swap to ``down_revision = "20260525_0006"`` (the last
landed Phase C migration). Detected at apply-time via Alembic's normal
chain validation.
