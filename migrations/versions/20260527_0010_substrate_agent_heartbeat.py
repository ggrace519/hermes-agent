"""substrate agent heartbeat — sub-agent liveness telemetry

Adds ``substrate_agent_heartbeat``: one row per substrate sub-agent
(``sentinel``, ``curator``, ``force-reject``, ``partition-maintenance``,
…), upserted on a fixed ~10s cadence by the sub-agent run loop. This is
the cross-process liveness surface the ``hermes substrate`` inspect CLI
reads to tell a *live* worker subprocess from a *dead* one.

Why a dedicated table rather than an L0 ``substrate.self_state`` slice:
a heartbeat is operational telemetry, not a *perception* the mind should
re-contact, reinforce, or consolidate. Folding it into L0 would flood the
perception store (Sentinel ticks at 0.2s) and pollute the Curator's
salience/pressure queries. A single-row last-writer-wins UPSERT keyed on
``agent_name`` is cheap, self-heals on worker restart (the new pid simply
overwrites the row), and is exactly the "sub-agent operational state"
read surface Phase F's real Conductor will consume (design §5.6, §6.3).
Substantive sub-agent *decisions* still go to ``substrate.self_state`` as
before; only the bare liveness beat lives here.

The ``last_beat_at`` default of ``now()`` (and the UPSERT's use of PG's
clock rather than the host clock) keeps staleness math skew-free: the
inspect CLI classifies live/stale/down purely from ``now() - last_beat_at``
evaluated server-side.
