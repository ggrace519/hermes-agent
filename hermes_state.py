"""
PostgreSQL State Store for Hermes Agent (Phase 0+).

Provides persistent session storage backed by PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector.
Stores session metadata, full message history, and model configuration for
CLI and gateway sessions.

Key design decisions:
- asyncpg connection pool managed by hermes_db
- Per-call connection acquisition (no per-instance state)
- Compression-triggered session splitting via parent_session_id chains
- Batch runner and RL trajectories are NOT stored here (separate systems)
- Session source tagging ('cli', 'telegram', 'discord', etc.) for filtering

            are preserved by plainto_tsquery. Falls back to an empty list on

        Context (±1 message) is appended as ``context`` on each row; full
        ``content`` is removed from the result to save tokens.
