"""ACP-suite-local fixtures.

The ACP session tests were written against SQLite SessionDB instances backed
by a per-test ``tmp_path/state.db`` file — each test started with a clean
database. After the PostgreSQL migration the SessionManager talks to the
shared ``hermes_db`` pool, so without explicit cleanup row-state from one
test leaks into the next (and breaks every assertion of the form
``assert manager.list_sessions() == []``).

This conftest restores the per-test clean-slate invariant by truncating
the session-shaped tables before and after each test. The pool itself is
left in place so we don't pay the connect / Alembic-replay cost per test.

def _reset_substrate_state() -> None:
    """Tear down any module-level substrate state from a prior test.

    Some acp tests (``test_entry``) invoke ``entry.main([])`` which calls
    ``bootstrap_substrate_sync``. That sets ``hermes_bootstrap._substrate_booted
    = True`` and binds ``substrate.events.hermes_hooks._substrate`` to the
    booted instance.

    After the per-test fixture closes the asyncpg pool, those module-level
    references are stale — the substrate instance holds a dead pool ref and
    the bound hooks dispatch into ``streams.get_by_name(...)`` which races
    on a closed connection. The downstream symptom in the next test:
    ``SessionDB.create_session`` opens a transaction, fires the
    ``on_session_start_async`` hook, the hook raises (caught by the outer
    try/except), but the transaction COMMITS the INSERT to a database the
    next test isn't querying — so ``get_session`` returns None.

    Resetting the bootstrap flags + unbinding hooks makes every acp test
    start with a clean slate. The actual ``Substrate.boot()`` runs again
    on demand in tests that need it; the cost is one extra
    ``ensure_partitions`` + ``_autoregister_streams`` round-trip per test
    that actually boots the substrate, which is negligible.

    Depends on ``hermes_db_initialized_sync`` so the per-test PG database

    the autouse fixture initialises the pool with whatever
    ``HERMES_PG_DSN`` the container started with (the shared compose
    database), and subsequent calls to ``ensure_pool_sync`` see
    ``_pool is not None`` and skip re-init — so the test ends up querying
    a different database from the one Alembic just migrated, and
    everything 500s with ``relation "sessions" does not exist``.

    prior test that booted the substrate (notably ``test_entry``) can't
