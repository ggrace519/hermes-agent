"""Regression for #21454: re-running install.sh on a symlinked prior install.

Older versions of ``install.sh`` created ``$link_dir/$CLI_NAME`` as a symlink
to the pip-generated entry point at ``$HERMES_BIN`` (i.e. ``venv/bin/hermes``).
When ``setup_path()`` later switched to writing a bash shim with
``cat > "$link_dir/$CLI_NAME" <<EOF``, the redirect followed the existing
symlink and overwrote the pip entry point with the shim. The shim's
``exec "$HERMES_BIN" "$@"`` then self-recursed and the CLI hung on every
invocation.

These tests pin the fix: ``setup_path()`` must remove ``$link_dir/$CLI_NAME``
before writing through the redirect, so the shim is created as a regular file
in ``link_dir`` and the venv entry point is left intact.

(The substrate-edition rewrite renamed ``command_link_dir`` → ``link_dir`` and
made the CLI name configurable via ``$CLI_NAME``; both before and after the
rewrite the regression class is identical, so this module pins the fix
through whichever variable names the script currently uses.)
