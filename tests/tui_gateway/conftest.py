"""Fixtures shared across tests/tui_gateway/.

Two Phase-0 patches both apply to every test in this subdirectory:

1.  ``tui_gateway.server`` wraps every SessionDB method with
    ``_hermes_db.run_sync(db.<method>(...))`` because
    ``_AsyncSessionDB`` methods are coroutines. The ``FakeDB`` classes
    used by ``test_protocol.py`` and friends are sync — their methods
    return plain values, not coroutines — so the real ``run_sync``
    crashes with ``TypeError: An asyncio.Future, a coroutine or an
    awaitable is required``. ``_pass_through_run_sync_for_sync_mocks``
    monkeypatches ``run_sync`` to pass non-awaitable values through;
    real coroutines (from production code paths under test) still go
    through the real ``run_sync``.

2.  ``hermes_cli.goals.GoalManager`` persists state via
    ``SessionDB.set_meta`` / ``get_meta`` — both async, both run
    through ``hermes_db.run_sync``. The ``test_goal_command.py`` tests
    rely on those writes landing for follow-up assertions, but the
    GoalManager swallows DB errors (intentionally — it must not crash
    the agent if the DB is down), so without a migrated per-test PG
    database the assertions silently see ``mgr.state is None``.
    ``_ensure_goal_pg_db`` requests ``hermes_db_initialized_sync`` for
    the goal tests so Alembic upgrade head has run and the asyncpg
    pool is bound to a real schema before any ``/goal`` command fires.
