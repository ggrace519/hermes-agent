"""Regression for install.sh update-safety: re-running the installer against
an existing $HERMES_HOME must not clobber user-customized config.

Concretely, the installer can be re-run for two distinct purposes:

  1. **Fresh install** — first time on this machine. No $HERMES_HOME state
     exists; the installer creates ``.env``, ``config.yaml``, ``SOUL.md``,
     writes ``HERMES_PG_DSN`` based on the docker-compose port it picked,
     and runs the interactive setup wizard so the user can configure a
     provider/model/API key.

  2. **Update** — second-or-later run, typically to pull new code into the
     existing checkout (handled by ``clone_repo`` via ``git pull``). The
     user already configured everything; rewriting their ``HERMES_PG_DSN``
     (which may point at a remote PG cluster they bring) or re-running the
     wizard from scratch is hostile.

These tests pin the static invariants that protect update mode by
inspecting ``scripts/install.sh``. They don't run the installer end-to-end
(that needs Docker, root, a real PG, etc.) — they verify the script's
shape so regressions surface in seconds rather than during user upgrades.
